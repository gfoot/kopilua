gfoot/KopiLua
=============

This is a modified version of KopiLua, with packaging changes and a lot of 
bug fixes.  See _README_ for the original author's comments, and _COPYRIGHT_ 
for his licensing terms.

I also included the LuaTestMore test suite, most of which passes now.  It's 
rigged up with nunitlite, and can be launched through Resharper, through the
standalone test harness app that's part of the solution, or through the Unity
project that's also provided as a demonstration that these tests all pass 
from within Unity too.

You may also be interested in KopiLuaInterface, which is a port of LuaInterface on top of this version of KopiLua, and the Unity demo app here which shows it
all in action within the Unity Webplayer (which is only possible with a pure
C# Lua implementation): http://gfootweb.webspace.virginmedia.com/LuaDemo/
